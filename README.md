## *Exercise tasks of "Advanced Functional Programming" course of University of Tampere.*

# Topics covered:

    
The **first week** is supposed to cover the basics of Haskell from http://learnyouahaskell.com/ starting from the beginning and reaching to  pattern matching and guards (4. Syntax of Functions)

The **second week** covered Learn you a Haskell until Modules.

The **third week** is supposed to cover at least Chapter 8 of Learn you a Haskell. BUT IT DID NOT: Making your own typeclasses is left to Week 4.

The **fourth week** was about functors and IO.

**Fifth week**: Exceptions, applicative functors, randomization, and reverse polish calculator example.

**Sixth week**: Monads, until the Writer monad, Difflists, and basics of Quickchek : http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/testing-and-quality-assurance.html

**Seventh week**:
- Tail recursion (just the factorial example was covered in the lecture) : http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vxs/teaching/Haskell/handouts/tail-recursion.pdf
- An introduction to lazy evaluation in Haskell. : https://github.com/pushcx/hpffp-resources/blob/master/Chapter%2027/The%20Incomplete%20Guide%20to%20Lazy%20Evaluation%201:%20How%20Lazy%20Evaluation%20Works%20in%20Haskell.pdf
- Software transactional memory (just the Balance example). : http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/software-transactional-memory.html
- Parallel programming (parallel sort) : http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/concurrent-and-multicore-programming.html
- Erlang vs Haskell slides by John Hughes : http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DAT280_Parallel_Functional_Programming/Material/ErlangIntro/slides.pdf
- Erlang: ping-pong example : http://erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html
