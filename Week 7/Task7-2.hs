Implement the following in Haskell, using concurrent programming: the main thread passes one string of characters a to z to one process, and another list of
characters a to z  to another process.
The processes how often each character from a to z appears in the list, and returns a list of (Char,Int) pairs, where e.g. ('b',9) would mean that the character b
appeard 9 times in the text. The main thread waits for the answers and calculates the total counts for each character and outputs that.
The input may be in the program source file.
